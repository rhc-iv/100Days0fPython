# Instructions

You are going to use **Dictionary Comprehension** to create a dictionary 
called `result` that takes each word in the given sentence and 
calculates the number of letters in each word. Try web searching to 
find out how to convert a sentence into a list of words.

**DO NOT** create a dictionary directly. Try to use **Dictionary 
Comprehension** instead of a **Loop**.

### Example Output

```
{
'What': 4, 
'is': 2, 
'the': 3, 
'Airspeed': 8, 
'Velocity': 8, 
'of': 2, 
'an': 2, 
'Unladen': 7, 
'Swallow?': 8
}
```

**_Hint:_**

Use the keyword method for starting the **Dictionary Comprehension** and 
fill in the relevant parts.

You can get a list of the words in a string by using the 
`.split()` method:
