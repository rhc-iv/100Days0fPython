# Instructions

You are going to write a **List Comprehension** to create a new list 
called `squared_numbers`. This new list should contain every number in 
the list `numbers` but each number should be squared.

e.g. 
`4 * 4 = 16`
4 squared equals 16.

**DO NOT** modify the List numbers directly. Try to use List 
Comprehension instead of a Loop.

Example Output
```
[1, 1, 4, 9, 25, 64, 169, 441, 1156, 3025]
```

_Hint_:

Use the keyword method for starting the List Comprehension and fill 
in the relevant parts. Make sure the `squared_numbers` is printed 
into the console for the code checking to work.
