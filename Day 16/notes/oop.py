# ---- Object-Oriented Programming ----

# Up to this point we've been writing our code with a style known as
# "Procedural Programming" which is a linear way of writing Python code.

# "Object-Oriented Programming" is a different type of approach to writing more
# complex code and the relationships that exist between those different parts
# of code (functions, et. al.) within our entire program.

# OOP is a concept that simplifies the relationships in our code and makes it
# scalable for larger, more dense projects.
