# Think of a CLASS as a type of "blueprint" that we will create by developing
# OBJECTS within it & these objects will be constructed using attributes (or
# variables) and methods (functions).

# Let's create a CLASS by using a car as our prototype. This class should 
# contain information about the car: what color the car is, how many wheels it
# should have, estimated miles-per-gallon and all of the other attributes of
# that car. The class should also contain data about how the car should be able
# to operate: its ability to drive, to stop & brake and so on. This data will
# be demonstrated through the class's methods.

# A CLASS is written in Python using PascalCase syntax: that is, each word that
# makes up the class is capitalized. Let's write out the class according to the
# correct syntax and within the framework of our example blueprint, a car:

#     car = CarBlueprint()

# In the above code, "car" is an OBJECT that is going to be created from our
# CLASS (or "blueprint"). The parentheses in the above example is important: in
# the same way that parentheses activate a function, the parentheses above will
# "activate" our OBJECT construction thru our creation of the CLASS. 

# In each iteration of Python, there is a built-in "blueprint" (or CLASS) known
# as "Turtle Graphics". To get a better understanding of OOP, we're going to
# use it in the file "main_tg.py" included in this directory.
