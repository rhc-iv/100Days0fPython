### API Authentication:

**API Authentication** is typically used to access either private data 
sources or data sources that have paid tiers. A lot of data sources that 
also have free tiers will requite **API Authentication** in order to prevent 
abuse of their **API**.

### API Keys:

An **API Key** is a personal key, generated from a data source, for 
individual users who want to have access to the **API**. In order to obtain 
an **API Key**, an account registration is usually required for individuals. 
Upon completion of the registration, the data source will generate an **API 
Key** for the user. This key is a unique identifier for that account & will 
be necessary to implement in the **Python** code that wishes to access that 
data source thru the **API**.
