# Day 14 Project

This **Course Section** project is a **High/Low** guessing game where the player will guess whether the statement presented (with numbers) is higher or lower than the value shown.  If the player guesses correctly, the game continues.  If the player guesses incorrectly, the game ends & the player's score is printed to the console.
