# Global constants are variables that you want to
# define & store...and NEVER change the data within
# them. Their values will be "constant" within your
# code.

# Still, we should be able to differentiate between
# constant variables and those variables that we want
# to manipulate the values of. In Python, the way
# we do this is by changing the naming convention 
# between the two types of variables. We already know
# that normal variables (that is, variables whose data
# can & will likely be change) use all lowercase letters.
# Well, with constant variables, the opposite is true: 
# we use all UPPERCASE letters for the variable name.

# Just because a constant variable has a different case
# doesn't mean that it can't be modified. The difference
# in case is to REMIND US that we plan on using that variable
# with a fixed & infallible value.
