# Use print() to:
#     just show the human user a string 
#     representing what is going on inside
#     your Python code.

# User return to:
#     ensure that a function gives back a
#     value. This value is often unseen by the
#     human user, but it can be used by the
#     computer in further functions.

# Print() functions in no way effect the function 
# that they're used in other to output human-readable
# information to the console.

# The 'return' keyword shows the calculated value
# of a function and can be used later on in the program.
# And empty 'return' keyword will also stop the 
# function it resides in and will show 'None' in
# the console. In other words, it can be used as
# an escape sequence.
