### Course Section Instructions:
> A text-based Python program to convert Strings into Morse Code.

---

All Course Section uploaded, from **Day 81** to **Day 100** are categorized within the heirarchy of the course as **Professional Portfolio Projects**.  Beyond a brief sentence describing the project, there is no further instruction and the students (including me) must fully develop the code (mainly using **Python**) to build a fully-formed and working app according the the project requirements. All `README.md` files for these Course Sections will quote the specific instructions for that day.
