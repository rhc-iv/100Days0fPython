# ---- TAKE A BREAK ----
# If you find yourself getting frustrated when debugging
# your code, it is often beneficial to take a break of some
# sort to clear your mind & alleviate some of the stress that
# you've built up over trying to correct issues in Python.

# ---- ASK A FRIEND ----
# Utilize the Discord channel for the Python Pro class or
# in other online spaces where Python is discussed, say
# Reddit or SomethingAwful!

# ---- RUN CODE OFTEN ----
# When writing code in Python (or any language), it is a
# good idea to run the code as you build it instead of waiting
# until you've completely written it. In this way, you're more
# apt to catching errors/bugs as they occur as opposed to possibly
# being presented with a host of errors/bugs that you will have to
# spend a longer time correcting.

# ---- ASK STACKOVERFLOW ----
# The StackOverflow website, in particular, is browsed &
# utilized my programmers all over the world. Many questions or
# issues you might encounter in your Python code have likely
# already been addressed on StackOverflow. Use it often!

# ---- ACCEPTANCE OF BUGS ----
# Finally, make peace with the fact that even the most
# senior-level programmers at every company that employs
# them introduce or run into bugs in their own Python
# code. What we need to focus on is that these bugs are 
# rarely unique, that our bugs are able to be corrected,
# and that with each debugging operation, we give ourselves
# an opportunity to become more proficient when writing
# in Python.
