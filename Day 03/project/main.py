# gathered via the input() function, so let's get started. Also notice
# that in order for punctuation (especially 's) not to get parsed as
# opening or closing parts of a string, we can use the "\" character to
# "escape" them so they're ignored & just parsed by Python as plain text
# instead of part of the code.
