# Comparison operators are used in Python to induce
# boolean statements about data based on whether or
# not that data meets the criteria of the operator or
# not.  They are listed below and (for purposes of the
# Day 3 Class Section) are introduced in the instruction
# about 'if/else' statements.

#   Operator       |      Condition
# -------------------------------------------------
#   >                     greater than
#   <                     less than
#   >=                    greater than OR equal to
#   <=                    less than OR equal to
#   ==                    equal to
#   !=                    not equal to

# There can be confusion over the difference between
# "=" and "==" in Python as, on the surface, it is easy
# to assume that they mean the same thing. Remember,
# though, that:

#     - We use "=" when we are assigning values to be stored as variables.
#       By doing this, we make the value 'true' for that variable and it
#       is also stored within the program for later recall.
#       (versus)
#     - We use "==" to compare values on the left and right of the operator.
#       In essence, "==" means that we are 'checking equality' on both sides
#       and the result is going to be a boolean value.
