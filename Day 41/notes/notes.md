# Introduction To HTML:

---

Websites are usually comprised of 3 different file types to display their 
data thru your web browser.

### HTML (Hyper-Text Markup Language):

`html` files are responsible for the structure of the website. So, `html` 
files are used to add such elements as `buttons`, `images`, and `input text 
boxes` to the website.

### CSS (Cascading StyleSheet):

`css` files are responsible for styling the website. `css` allows the coder 
to specify how they want the website to look. For instance, `css` could be 
used to define the color and the text style of a `button` in the `html` file.

### JavaScript:

`js` files control a website's ability to do things or its behavior.
