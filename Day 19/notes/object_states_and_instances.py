# Object instances are simply objects created from the same class
# that operate independently of one another. For example, 'tim',
# which is our object based off of the Turtle() class can be iterated
# as separate instances (or objects) as shown below:

#   tim = Turtle()
#   tom = Turtle()

# Each of these objects, when called, will have their own attributes
# & methods that will be acted upon separately within Python. The
# attributes & methods of each of these objects are known as the
# object's STATE.
